For linting our Python project, we have several options to choose from, including Flake8, Ruff, or Pylint.
Flake8 is a widely used tool that combines the functionality of PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and mccabe to check for PEP 8 compliance, errors, and code complexity, while
Ruff is faster. Pylint has an extensive set of rules for detecting errors, enforcing coding standards, and suggesting improvements. 
For testing, we have some frameworks to choose from like unittest, pytest, or doctest: 
unittest is the standard library and provides a well-defined structure for writing tests. 
pytest it provides simplicity it has things like fixtures, plugins, and running tests in parallel.
With doctest we will have to write tests within the documentation (called docstrings).
For the CI/CD, options like GitLab CI and Argo Workflows can be effective: GitLab CI has built-in Docker support and native integration with GitLab repositories, 
making it a strong choice for teams already using GitLab. Argo Workflows is for complex CI/CD pipelines.
For self-hosted solutions if we have complex requirements some alternatives are: CircleCI and Apache Airflow.
CircleCI allows to run workflows in a self-hosted environment.
Apache Airflow is used for orchestrating more complex workflows, especially for data pipelines.
Finally, deciding between all those options will depend on our budget, the project Requirements (for specific requirements like complex workflows a self-hosted solution may be better.
However, if the requirements are standard, a cloud-based solution like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI could be sufficient. 
In terms of maintenance and setup, cloud based options are easier to set up and have less  maintenance. Self hosted solutions give more control of the environment but require
more configuration.
